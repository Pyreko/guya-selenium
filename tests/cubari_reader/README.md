# Cubari Reader Tests

Just a WIP document for me to keep track of what tests I've written and stuff.

The following things are tested for the Cubari reader:

## Searching

- Results for title search - both valid and invalid searches

- Results for text search - both valid and invalid searches

- Clicking on a result from title search take you to the correct chapter.

- Clicking on the chapter result from the text search take you to the correct chapter.

- Clicking on the page result from the text search take you to the correct chapter and page.
